            Why recycle? The ice caps are melting and the turtles are dying!
          </p>
          <p>
            With the public becoming increasingly aware of enviornmental concerns, consumers are becoming more cognizant about their environmental footprints.
            Our team decided to create a product that will help consumers be more enviornmentally conscious of the impact they have on earth: meet RecycleID.
          </p>
          <p>
            RecycleID is a system that allows consumers to automatically keep track of their waste habits to make it easier for them to understand their impact on the enviornment.
            Our solution is RecycleID, a product that will help consumers change their trash habits by tracking consumer waste and educating them on what is actually recycable or compostable to decrease the amount of trash sent to the landfill.
